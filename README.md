Interact with your email records using natural language. You can say:

* “Give me every receipt in my inbox in CSV format, with the following columns: gmail link to the email, sender email, sender name, amount in the receipt.”

* “Give me every subscription in my inbox including cancelled subscriptions. Tell me what my monthly subscription bill is” (you can probably get this out of the last one)
* “Tell me every service I’ve ever logged into or signed up for along with time of last login”
* “Identify everyone who is sending me messages that I don’t read, and unsubscribe from them.”
* “Identify the senders who are sending the highest ratio of emails in to emails replied to”
* “Identify the most important people in terms of the number of emails sent to them”
